My project is going to simulate the orbits of planets and satellites. I'd like
 to make it in 3D but that might be too difficult. I am going to code it in C
 and I plan on using SDL for graphics. My target platform is Linux, as that is
 what I use but with SDL it should just work on windows without changing it 
too much. \\
My end user is Dr. Naylor (dnaylor@kefw.org), I have talked to him and he 
showed me his existing solution, which was a simple application embedded in 
a website. It was a simple application and it only showed the planets as small 
circles that orbited other small circles, and included options to change the 
planet, the eccentricity or the orbit and some other stuff. I plan on doing 
something more complex than this. I'm thinking that I could do it as a program 
for the students to use, rather than the teacher to use in front of the class. \\
I need to do some more research into what equations I should use to calculate 
the planets trajectories, but once I decide and I understand it, it should be 
relatively easy to code. The hardest part will be the graphics (I think). 
Making spheres shouldn't be too hard, and once I've worked out the equations it 
should be pretty easy to position them, but I think making a nice user interface 
will be difficult.
