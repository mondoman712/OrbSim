* Analysis
** TODO Objectives
   + Number them
   + Be more specific; 'certain parameters'
   + Include others:
     - Easy to use
     - Small learning curve
     - Used by students and teachers
** TODO DFDs
   + For current and proposed systems
   + Level 1 and level 2 
** TODO Possible solutions
   + Should be ones that already exist and I have covered in research

** TODO Context diagram
   + Textbook p237
** TODO ADD 
   + I need it
** TODO Algorithms in the current system
   + Shows you are using things correctly
   + Shows you are using *complex* maths
** TODO OOP
   + Need inheritence diagrams
** TODO Any other things not covered
   + TODO find out what needs doing

* Design
** TODO Overall system design
   + Either explanation of IPSO table
   + Or flow chart
   + Introduce the section, explain briefly what design covers
** TODO Annotate HCI
   + To indicate User input
** TODO Structure chart
   + Uses wrong shapes
   + Has no data flow
   + AS textbook p86
** TODO Algorithms
   + In structured english or pseudocode
** TODO Data design dictionary
** TODO ERD
   + For class definitions
** TODO Explain file organisation
   + Is there any?


* Testing
** TODO Introduce the section
** TODO Put it in a table
   + ?
** TODO Evaluation
   + Does it work as it should?
   + How did I approach the testing?
   + Strengths and weaknesses of the system, based on the tests

* Maintainance
** TODO Move dev env to start
** TODO Explain modular structure
** TODO Talk about test results
   + Programmers need to know which code produced which outcome
** TODO More program listing
   + From Implementation section to appendices,
     then explain code and refer to program listing in appendix
** TODO System settings and config
   + What needs to be installed


* User manual
** TODO Introduction
   + What it covers and who could use it
** TODO Full install guide
   + With screenshots
** TODO More screen shots
** TODO Describe screenshots

* Evaluation
** TODO Number Objectives
** TODO Need to write as report
   + With into, main body and conclusion
   + Refer to objectives
