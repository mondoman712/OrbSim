\section{Function Design}

\subsection{draw-bodies}
The draw-bodies function is used to call the draw-body function on a list of
bodies. This allows the bodies to be kept in a list and outputted easily from
that list.

\begin{pseudocode}{draw-bodies}{bodies}
	\IF bodies
	  \THEN 
	    \BEGIN
	    	\CALL{draw-body}{$first item in bodies$} \\
		\CALL{draw-bodies}{$rest of bodies$}
	    \END
	  \ELSE
      	    \RETURN{\TRUE}	
\end{pseudocode}

\begin{lstlisting}
(defun draw-bodies (bodies)
  (if bodies
      (progn (draw-body (car bodies))
	     (draw-bodies (cdr bodies)))
      `t)) 
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{update-vel}
This function is used to update the velocity of a body. The pseudocode is
simplified to make it easier to understand, I've just removed some of the
function calls for $accel$ and grouped the $x$ and $y$ values. 

\begin{pseudocode}{update-vel}{body}
	\BEGIN
	accel \GETS \CALL{split-force}{\CALL{calc-g}{sun, body}, 
					\CALL{ang}{sun, body}} \\
	bodyvel \GETS bodyvel + accel
	\END
\end{pseudocode}

\begin{lstlisting}
(defun update-vel (body)
  (let ((accel (split-force 
                 (calc-g (mass *sun*) (dist (pos body) (pos (car *bodies*)))
                 (ang (pos (car *bodies*)) (pos body)))))
    (sets #`+ (x (vel body)) (x accel))
    (sets #`+ (y (vel body)) (y accel))))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{read-bodies}
This is used to read through the list of lists in a file and turn each list
within the main list into a body in the system. \\
\begin{pseudocode}{read-bodies}{filename}
	\FOREACH bod $ in $ \CALL{read-list}{filename}
	\DO $collect $ \CALL{make-body}{bod} $ into $ bods\\
	\RETURN{bods}
\end{pseudocode}

\begin{lstlisting}
(defun read-bodies (filename)
  (loop for bod in (read-list filename)
       collecting (make-instance 
		   `body
		   :pos (make-instance
			 `point
			 :x (nth 0 bod)
			 :y (nth 1 bod))
		   :vel (make-instance
			 `point
			 :x (nth 2 bod)	
			 :y (nth 3 bod))
		   :mass (nth 4 bod)
		   :size (nth 5 bod)
		   :colour (sdl:color :r (nth 6 bod)
				      :g (nth 7 bod)
				      :b (nth 8 bod)))))
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Development Environment}
Orbsim has developed using, and has been tested with SBCL (Steel Bank Common
Lisp). It will only run in SBCL due to the fact that I've used SBCL's threading
features and not all Lisp Implementations support threading, and those that do
implement it differently. The "Lispbuilder-SDL" package is required, and it is
advised that QuickLisp is used to install it (if not the start of "main.lisp"
will need to be changed). 

\section{External Libraries used}
\subsection{SDL}
I used SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) to produce graphics for my program, so SDL
is required for my program to run. I used a library called "Lispbuilder-SDL" to
allow me to interface with SDL from Lisp, this is not required for the program
to run as it compiles itself into the executable.

\subsection{Tk}
I used Tk as it allowed me to easily create a graphical menu system. I used the
LTk library to interface with Tk from Lisp.
