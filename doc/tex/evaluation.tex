\part{Evaluation}

% TODO:
% 	Did it meet its goals?
% 	Why not?
% 	(Don't say ran out of time)
%
%	Break requirements into input, processing, output
% 	Split evaluation into:
% 		Effectiveness
% 		Usability
% 		Maintainability
%
%	Report on:
%		Has each requirement been met?
%			(don't say no time or too hard)
%		If not what has been met and why
%		Talk to end user
%
%
% DO WRITE GOOD

\section{Effectiveness}
%	Effectiveness:
%		Talk about how well I met each target
%		Overall how effective is it?
%		I need to determine the criteria for this
%		A complete evaluation including:
%			Planning
%			Planning time
%			Execution time
%			Your own criteria 
\subsection{Comparison of objectives against finished system}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.5\textwidth}p{0.5\textwidth}}
	Original Objective & Completed System \\\hline
	The system should give a clear visualisation of Kepler's Laws &
	Partially completed. The system will show the orbits of the planets, and
	thus show Kepler's laws but there is nothing additional to give clear
	visualisations of them.\\
	The system should allow the user to edit certain parameters & Partially
	completed. The systems lets the user add bodies with different
	parameters (although not the eccentricity directly), but they cannot be
	edited once they have been added. \\
	The system needs to run smoothly on the school computers & \\
	The system needs to be very easy to use & \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Usability}
%	Learnability:
%		How easy is your system to learn?
%		Include examples
%		Comment on design and UI
%		Make up excuses as to why it sucks
%			(not just that I couldn't get it to work
%
%	Usability:
%		Easy to use - high usability
%		focuses on HCI
%		Target acquisition time
%			ID = log_2(2A/W)
%			ID = index of difficulty
%			A = Distance to move
%			W = size of target
%		Latency
%			How long does it take to do things?
%			Does it let the user know its loading?
%		Metaphors - pictures to guide users
%		How easy is it to navigate?
%		Readability
%			High contrast?
%			Large fonts
%			Clearly displayed
%			Not too much extra info
%		Ability to reverse/confirm certain actions
%		A way out?
\section{Maintainability}
%	Maintainability:
%			Bug fixing
%			Changing parameters
%			New requirements
%		How easy are these to do?
%			Is the software modular?
%			Is there independent units
%			Self documenting code?
%			Entry and exit points in code
%			Minimal global use
%		Evaluating maintenance document
