\part{Evaluation}

% TODO:
% 	Did it meet its goals?
% 	Why not?
% 	(Don't say ran out of time)
%
%	Break requirements into input, processing, output
% 	Split evaluation into:
% 		Effectiveness
% 		Usability
% 		Maintainability
%
%	Report on:
%		Has each requirement been met?
%			(don't say no time or too hard)
%		If not what has been met and why
%		Talk to end user
%
%	Effectiveness:
%		Talk about how well I met each target
%		Overall how effective is it?
%		I need to determine the criteria for this
%		A complete evaluation including:
%			Planning
%			Planning time
%			Execution time
%			Your own criteria 
%
%	Learnability:
%		How easy is your system to learn?
%		Include examples
%		Comment on design and UI
%		Make up excuses as to why it sucks
%			(not just that I couldn't get it to work
%
%	Usability:
%		Easy to use - high usability
%		focuses on HCI
%		Target acquisition time
%			ID = log_2(2A/W)
%			ID = index of difficulty
%			A = Distance to move
%			W = size of target
%		Latency
%			How long does it take to do things?
%			Does it let the user know its loading?
%		Metaphors - pictures to guide users
%		How easy is it to navigate?
%		Readability
%			High contrast?
%			Large fonts
%			Clearly displayed
%			Not too much extra info
%		Ability to reverse/confirm certain actions
%		A way out?
%	
%	Maintainability:
%			Bug fixing
%			Changing parameters
%			New requirements
%		How easy are these to do?
%			Is the software modular?
%			Is there independent units
%			Self documenting code?
%			Entry and exit points in code
%			Minimal global use
%		Evaluating maintenance document
%
% DO WRITE GOOD
