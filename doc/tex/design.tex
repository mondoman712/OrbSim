\end{figure}

This is a basic mockup of what I intend for the interface to look like. It looks
quite similar to the old system's interface, so it will be familiar to the user
and they won't have to learn a lot in order to use it.

\section{Hardware Specification}

My program needs to run on the computers at school, which have:
\begin{description}
	\item[Processor:] Intel Core i3 @ 3.3GHz
	\item[RAM:] 4GB
	\item[Graphics:] Intel HD 2000
	\item[Operating System:] Windows 7
\end{description}

The program will also need basic input and output devices, a monitor, keyboard
and mouse. A projector is also recommended for using the program to explain
Kepler's laws in front of a class.

\section{Possible Algorithms to Use}

\subsection{Description}

A big part of my program is the actual simulation of the orbits of some
simulated planets. To simulate and orbit a complex algorithm is required, and
there's a few different ones to choose from. \\

The Barnes-Hut Tree is a method for performing N-Body simulations, which means
that every body in the simulation will be interacting with every other body.
This, however, isn't very useful for a basic model of a simulation of a solar
system, as the planets generally don't interact with each other very much. It
will allow for more complex simulations, but this isn't necessary for my
project. \\

The simulation can be simplified to a two body problem, between one planet and
the sun, because the planets aren't affecting each other. This can then be
further simplified to a one body problem, because the sun is much more massive
than a planet, so it can be thought of as the centre of mass. \\

Newton's \emph{law of universal gravitation} states that two bodies, with masses
$m_1$ and $m_2$, separated my $r$ are attracted to each other with equal and
opposite forces directed along the line joining the bodies. The magnitude of
this force is given by:

\begin{equation}
	F = G (\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2})	
\end{equation}

where G is the constant of gravitation (approx. $6.67 N-m^2/kg^2$). We can then
ignore one of the masses, because its significantly less than the other, and
calculate the acceleration towards the object using:

\begin{equation}
	g = \frac{GM}{r^2}
\end{equation}

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and M is the mass of the larger
body. The new position of the body can then be calculated using its current
position and velocity.

\begin{pseudocode}{calc-new-pos}{pos, vel, parentbody}
	r \GETS dist(pos, parentbody)	 \\
	g \GETS (G \cdot parentmass)/r^2 \\
	newvel \GETS vel + g \\
	\RETURN {pos + (newvel \cdot interval)}
\end{pseudocode}

\begin{pseudocode}{dist}{body1, body2}
	x \GETS \lvert body1x - body2x \lvert \\
	y \GETS \lvert body1y - body2y \lvert \\
	\RETURN {\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
\end{pseudocode}

	This algoritm takes the position of the body in question, its mass 
	and the mass and position of the parent body. It then calculates the body's
	accelleration towards its parent, which can be used to calculate its new postion. \\
